## Customer Churn Analysis Power BI Dashboard

# Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive Customer Churn Analysis dashboard developed using Power BI. The dashboard is designed to provide key insights into customer behavior, identify factors contributing to churn, and help businesses make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention.

## Key Features & Insights
The dashboard focuses on several critical areas to provide a holistic view of customer churn:

# Churn Metrics at a Glance: 
Displays essential metrics such as "Customer at Risk," "Number of Tech Tickets," "Number of Admin Tickets," "Yearly Charges," and "Monthly Charges" to quickly assess the churn landscape.

# Customer Demographics: 
Breaks down churned customers by gender and subscription time (tenure), offering insights into which demographic segments are more prone to churn.

# Subscribed Services Analysis: 
Visualizes the impact of various subscribed services (e.g., Streaming TV, Streaming Movies, Phone Services, Online Security, Device Protection, Online Backup, Tech Support) on churn, highlighting services that might be linked to higher or lower churn rates.

# Multiple Lines & Internet Service Usage: 
Investigates churn behavior based on whether customers have multiple lines and their internet service type (Fiber optic, DSL, No internet service).

# Contract, Billing, and Payment Methods: 
Analyzes the distribution of churn by contract type (Month-to-Month, One year, Two years), paperless billing preference, and various payment methods, revealing potential points of friction or dissatisfaction.

1.Identify Churn Drivers: Pinpoint the underlying reasons why customers are churning.

2.Segment At-Risk Customers: Help businesses identify and target customers who are most likely to churn.
